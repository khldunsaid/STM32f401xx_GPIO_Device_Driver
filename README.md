# STM32f401xx_Device_Driver

This repository is a capstone project for a self-learning plan that I put to teach myself How to build Reusable Firmware Development for ARM-based microcontrollers.

where I divided the road map into two parts:

### Theoretical:
I read ["Reusable Firmware Development: A Practical Approach to APIs, HALs, and Drivers](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232965) book which purposes to help the embedded software engineers learn and understand how they can develop reusable firmware that can be used across multiple microcontroller platforms and software products. The fundamental pieces to firmware reuse that focusing on are HALs, APIs, and drivers. These are the core pieces that will allow them to develop layered software architecture and define how those different layers interact with each other.

### Practical:
I built Device Drivers for [NUCLEO-F401RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html) from scratch
